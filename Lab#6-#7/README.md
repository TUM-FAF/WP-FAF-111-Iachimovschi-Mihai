# Topic: WinRT API.
## Intro

## Completed Mandatory Objectives
* Create an application that will get JSON from fucking-great-advice.ru and will place the results on a grid layout with detail view.

## Completed Objectives With Points
* Your application should have at least 3 screens/windows **(3 pt)**
* Intuitive design **(2 pt)**
* Follow WinRT applications life cycle **(2 pt)**

## Development Process
The process was very interesting because developing a WinRT app is very similar to the process of creation of a web app.
The concept of using CSS/JS/HTML on desktop apps seems strange, but I've already had some little experience with GNOME 3 (GNOME Shell) which is pretty similar.

## Outro
Switching from Win32 API to WinRT API was very useful for us, because we finally used a more up to date technology.
Overall I liked this course, the red pill laboratory works and the team work for the 5th laboratory work.
Thanks for having great time learning these technologies.
